I love video games. But it's a rocky relationship.

## as a vehicle for programming

Games are why I first learned to use computers; from ages 4-8, my parents only let me play typing games, drilling into me the importance of computer skills.

Games taught me to code. When I was 9, my parents let me explore video games, provided I knew how to make them. I learned to code in [Adobe Flash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash) (CS3, on Vista!), and uploaded my games to [Newgrounds](https://www.newgrounds.com/), [Miniclip](https://www.miniclip.com/games/en/#privacy-settings), and [Kongregate](https://www.kongregate.com/) - to poor reviews.

Games pushed me to program more. I dove into [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/) modding and learned Java to make my own (buggy) mods with [Forge](https://minecraftforge.net). [ComputerCraft](https://www.computercraft.info/) motivated me to pick up [Lua](https://www.lua.org/), and I learned logic gates through Redstone and [RedPower](http://www.eloraam.com/).

Games were the first type of programming that I taught. In high school, I created a game development class for kids in [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/).

Games were why I joined [ACM at UCLA](https://uclaacm.com); the first events I attended were [Studio](https://uclaacmstudio.itch.io/)'s [Unity Tutorials](https://github.com/uclaacm/studio-beginner-tutorials-f21).

I cannot emphasize how lucky I am to have learned programming at a young age. Video games gave me the life I have now.

## as an art form

Video games created my favourite experiences:

* [Portal 2](https://www.thinkwithportals.com/) is my favourite video game. The art, music, and narrative is top-notch; the level design is stellar; the puzzles blew my mind.
* [Antichamber](http://www.antichamber-game.com/) made me question reality. This is the modern [M.C. Escher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._C._Escher).
* [Hades](https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/hades/) is my favourite reimagination of Greek mythology.
* The visuals of [Ori and the Blind Forest](https://www.orithegame.com/), [Gris](https://www.devolverdigital.com/games/gris), and [Transistor](https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/transistor/) are breathtaking; Transistor's soundtrack is equally mesmerizing.
* [Breath of the Wild](https://www.zelda.com/breath-of-the-wild/) and [Skyrim](https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/en/skyrim) build worlds that rival the greatest fantasy franchises.
* Minecraft, [Terraria](https://terraria.org/), and [Starbound](https://playstarbound.com/) are vanguards of creative building.

I'll also shout out [DOOM](https://bethesda.net/en/game/doom), [Civ V](https://civilization.com/civilization-5/), [Borderlands 2](https://2k.com/en-US/game/borderlands-2/), [Slime Rancher](http://www.slimerancher.com/), [Stardew Valley](https://www.stardewvalley.net/), or [Mini Metro](https://dinopoloclub.com/games/mini-metro/).

## as a time sink

My playtime in those games is dwarfed by just two: [CS:GO](https://counter-strike.net/) and [League of Legends](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/). These are good games. However, ...

*Addicting* is the right descriptor. Both consumed thousands of hours of my life.

Some of it was quality time with friends, but in retrospect, it was mostly mindless. I wished I spent time on other games instead - like [The Witcher 3](https://thewitcher.com/en/witcher3), [Mirror's Edge](https://www.ea.com/games/mirrors-edge/mirrors-edge), or [Hollow Knight](https://www.hollowknight.com/). Or sleeping.

Playing competitive multiplayer games isn't *bad*. I got too drawn into them, and they stopped being fun; that's bad.

## in the future

I still occasionally play League, and I just finished Gris and started DOOM Eternal. Moving forward, I want to spend time playing games that ignited my passion.

I'll end by paraphrasing my friend in Discord, while we were playing League:

> When I'm 50, I want to still be playing games. Not because they fill something missing in me. Because they're fun.
