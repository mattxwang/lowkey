## Preamble

This is it!

In my [last post]({% post_url 2021-12-31-reflecting-on-teach-la %}), I said that running Teach LA was the most impactful experience I've had at UCLA. That wasn't a lie. However, looking back now, running ACM was scaling that by an order of magnitude: both in terms of potential impact/scope and stress! It is a unique position that I'm grateful to have had, but wouldn't wish upon anybody else.

So, like the last one, this post is long overdue. I'm concerned I'm already sounding like a broken record, but it's *so absurdly hard* to explain why this one organization dominated my life. If you'll stick with me through it, I'll take you on a journey. One that explores being the president of ACM at UCLA, but takes a few pit stops along the way:

- What's the CS & tech culture at UCLA like?
- What makes ACM at UCLA unique?
- What is the role of student organizations in institutions, infrastructure, and advocacy?
- What does "we're too big", "it's just a club", and "burnout" really mean?
- How much can one person - or one organization - do in 4 years?
- And above all, how much of an impact did we - and I - have?

The main focus of this essay isn't necessarily summarizing my time running ACM at UCLA - though that'll be a sizeable chunk. ACM is just a vehicle for me to explore the extraordinarily complex world of student organizations in higher education. It's an admittedly niche field, but it's also one with built-in turnover. Above all, I want to make sure that the future generation really does learn from my mistakes - and does a better job than me.

This is going to be a **long essay**. If you don't finish it, I won't blame you - it took me a while to even finish writing it.
