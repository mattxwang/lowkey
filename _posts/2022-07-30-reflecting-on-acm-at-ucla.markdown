## Preamble

This is it!

In my [last post]({% post_url 2021-12-31-reflecting-on-teach-la %}), I said that running Teach LA was the most impactful experience I've had at UCLA. That wasn't a lie.

But since that year, running the largest CS club on campus - and I wager, one of the largest in the country - was a transformative experience. The stakes and potential for impact, the politics, the stress - all things I had never experienced. It's a truly unique experience that I don't think many others have (or should have to go through).

So, like the last one, this post is long overdue. If you'll stick with me through it, I'll take you on a journey; one that explores being the president of ACM at UCLA, but takes a few pit stops along the way:

- What's the CS & tech culture at UCLA like?
- What makes ACM at UCLA unique?
- What is the role of student organizations in institutions, infrastructure, and advocacy?
- What does "we're too big", "it's just a club", and "burnout" really mean?
- How many problems can be solved by better tech?
- How much can one person - or one organization - do in 4 years?
- And above all, how much of an impact did we - and I - have?

The main focus of this essay isn't necessarily summarizing my time running ACM at UCLA - though that'll be a sizeable chunk. ACM is just a vehicle for me to explore the extraordinarily complex world of student organizations in higher education. It's an admittedly niche field, but it's also one with built-in turnover and fundamentally unique problems and impacts. Above all, I want to make sure that the future generation really does learn from my mistakes - and does a better job than me.

This is going to be a **long essay**. If you don't finish it, I won't blame you - it took me a while to even finish writing it.

### Some Important Words

On ACM:

- [**ACM at UCLA**](https://uclaacm.com), or colloquially, **ACM**, is the largest computer science club on campus at UCLA. It juggles a role as the de facto CS student organization and as an entrypoint for students to learn about CS & tech.
  - Technically, we're a student chapter of the international [Association for Computing Machinery](#TODO)
- ACM is split into various **committees** which focus on different topics.
  - I previously ran [**ACM Teach LA**](https://teachla.uclaacm.com), which provides equitable access to K-12 CS education in LA. More about that in my [general (2021)]({% post_url 2021-12-31-reflecting-on-teach-la %}) and [Reflecting on the Teach LA Dev Team (2020)]({% post_url 2020-06-27-reflecting-on-tla-dev-team %}) and [dev team (2020)]({% post_url 2020-06-27-reflecting-on-tla-dev-team %}) reflections.
  - other core focus on areas like AI & machine learning, video game development/design, and diversity in tech.
  - ACM "**Board**" is *not* a committee, but a centralized org that does infrastructural work: logistics, developer teams, marketing, etc. There's a (somewhat arbitrary) split of internal / external.
- An "**officer**" is someone who holds a leadership position in ACM; in contrast, a "**general member**" has no commitment and can come and go as they please.
  - Anybody can be a general member, but officers typically need to apply/be interviewed.
  - one way this is done is through ACM's "**internship program**", which is basically a baby-officer program.
- The "**PVP**" are the President and Vice-Presidents of the entirety of ACM; they're elected simulatneously. The VPs run their own sections of Board (Internal, External), and in theory I oversee the entire club.
- In contrast, the CPrez (committee presidents) run individual committees. Some are elected by their committees, while others are picked by their previous leadership. Board is not involved.
- We have about **255 officers** and around 500, 1200, or 2000 general members (depending on how you count).

And on UCLA as a whole:

- The engineering school at UCLA is formally called **HSSEAS**, though I'll often just write **SEAS**.
- At UCLA, the CS department sits under engineering (opposed to somewhere like Waterloo)

### ACM at UCLA's Past, abridged

It's not clear exactly when the ACM chapter here was founded or when it was solidly revived - this was a project that I had tried to undertake but never saw through. What I can tell you is that, ~ 2010, the club started becoming a lot more popular.

### Matt's Past, abridged (2018-2021)

## A "Short" Play-by-Play

Unlike the last one, I'll be quite a bit briefer with this section. Mostly because there's just too much to talk about, and I'm not trying to bore you.

### tl;dr (resume format)

### Spring Quarter, 2021

I got elected! Along with Evan (my Internal Vice President/IVP) and Tina (my External Vice President/EVP).

Our first step is to elect our new board. For ACM Board, any prior officer/intern can run for a position, and the entire officer core votes. If there are unfilled positions, we publish an open application and typically pick these by interview.

### Things I Can't (or won't) Say

I still try to maintain my "don't talk shit about people on the internet" rule. As a result, this extremely long blog post still doesn't cover everything I have to say on this topic. Here are some things I've excluded from this post, but still linger:

- (individual) bad actors in ACM, CS at UCLA, and SEAS: students, admin, etc. there's a lot!
- detailed descriptions of (internal and external) failure points in projects: ethics reform, research portal, membership portal, etc.
- casual sexism and toxic masculinity in the CS major
- friendships and relationships blowing up :(
- gossip and things in the rumour mill

And there are also some things that I think are out of scope of this post, but are related:

- the fundamental misalignment of computer science and software engineering education
- restructuring funding models for CS in engineering
- the absurdity of college rankings
- the absurdity of college applications
- ageism in tech
- crypto, hype-trains, and grifting

Who knows, maybe I'll write another post about these soon!

### Shoutouts

I want to end this post on a positive note. Even though I never got the direct collaborator I was looking for, there are swathes of people that enriched my time running this club, supported me through my worst, and empowered me to do my best. Here's a few!

Of those in ACM:

- To my peers:
  - **Ellie** and **Rohit** continue to amaze me: they have an infinite depth of knowledge, an astoundingly consistent work ethic, *and* a life outside of CS! It warmed my heart to see Rohit win the Outstanding Bachelor of CS award.
  - To my stellar Teach LA collaborators - particularly **Bonnie**, **Malak**, **Pragathi**, and **Shane** pulling it all together in our first year!
  - I could not have done the Teach LA dev team or the learning lab crash course without **Leo**!
  - I am particularly thankful to **Evan** and **Tina** for sticking through some especially rough patches this year.
  - Working with Studio, particularly **Christian**, **Peter**, and **Athena** was so easy and fulfilling - I loved it!
  - I have the utmost respect and a reverence for **William** - I cannot think of someone else who has given more to this club.
  - **Arjun** has (and likely always will be) the most impactful person I have met in college. I cannot thank them enough for the new perspectives that they've brought to almost every sphere of my life.
- And to the giants whose shoulders I stood on - particularly **Rucha**, **Megha**, **Yvonne**, and **Christina** - thank you for paving the way!
- A special shoutout to **Sharvani**, who simulatenously was a stellar collaborator *and* a giant - her impact and empathy is unmatched.
- To some of the kindest and smartest souls that don't fit into any of these buckets, but still defined my time here: **Crystal**, **Eugene**, **Jacob**, **Jason**, **Jody**, **Mark**, **Maya**, **Muthu**, **Nhi**, **Nikhil**, **Nikil**, **Reiya**
- I'll always be thankful to **Connor**, **Jamie**, and **Alyssa**. They were my first home in tech at UCLA, my first true friends in the major, and always gave great advice.

And those not:

- **Karen** was a stellar partner in crime and the unfortunate victim of too many of my rants. Her curiosity and empathy always stood out!
- I have a tremendous respect for **Bryan**, whose leadership and tech expertise at [Creative Labs](https://www.creativelabsucla.com/) routinely inspired me - and has impact in ACM!
- I absolutely loved working with [QWER Hacks](https://www.qwerhacks.com/) - special love to Spurthi, Isabel, and Christine!
- **Laurel** was so impressive as the lead of BEAM, especially in navigating online outreach - she deserves all the praise in the world.
- Similarly, **Lisa**, **Vivian**, and **Aidan** paved the way for an inclusive BEAM that set the standard for how I should lead.
- **Alex, Allison, Emmy, Kendrake, Max, Sam, and Zian** were all titans of UCLA CS & tech in their own right - and were all great collaborators, sounding boards, or just people to talk to!
- And of course, to **Annie**, who ran the [Society of Women Engineers](https://www.swe-ucla.com/) (SWE). We rarely "talked about work", but she always lent an ear and was a comforting friend - and heard too many rants from me.

I have an idea to eventually categorize all of this in a website. Stay tuned :)
