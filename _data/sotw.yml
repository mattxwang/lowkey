    I did end up going Far Away! But beyond that, EASHA is definitely someone to look out for - her groove is so springly and joyful.

    A friend reminded me of this song, and other than the slightly-cringe outro on Tarantino movies, the flow is still as smooth as it was seven years ago.

    The MarÃ­as knock it out of the park with their debut studio album. They blend together dreamy synths, a powerful but mesmerizing bass, and MarÃ­a's hypnotizing voice to paint their signature sound.

    Hypotheticals is insanely catchy. Rachael Price's voice layers over a beautiful medley of keyboards and strings. The bassline is so groovy. And, above all, the song's progression is perfectly timed. Immaculate.
