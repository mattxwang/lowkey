    A friend reminded me of this song, and other than the slightly-cringe outro on Tarantino movies, the flow is still as smooth as it was seven years ago.

    The Marías knock it out of the park with their debut studio album. They blend together dreamy synths, a powerful but mesmerizing bass, and María's hypnotizing voice to paint their signature sound.

    Tkay is absolutely killing it (and one of my fave rising stars) - she effortlessly blends innovative beats, graceful singing, and absolute bars. Can't wait for a full album.

    Hypotheticals is insanely catchy. Rachael Price's voice layers over a beautiful medley of keyboards and strings. The bassline is so groovy. And, above all, the song's progression is perfectly timed. Immaculate.
