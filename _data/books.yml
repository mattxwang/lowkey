    Kafka on the Shore was my first Murakami venture, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The world that Murakami weaves is immaculate; I feel at home in a place that I've never been in. Kafka's ensemble of characters bring just enough to the table to make every chapter a page-turner, but leave plenty to the imagination - and something that makes this coming-of-age story easily and eerily relatable.

    At ICYD 2016 (a debate competition in London), I watched some of the world's best youth debaters argue over the concept of open borders. At the time (especially given the rise of anti-immigration sentiment in Europe), it seemed like a tough principle to advocate for, but Bryan Caplan does a pretty solid attempt at doing just that in Open Borders. I do think that the comic book medium is narratively interesting (and I love SMBC), but I think it might've hindered Caplan's message just a bit - especially as he has less leeway to delve deep into rigorous economic experiments. And at the end of the day, many open borders arguments are in a "what if" limbo, but Caplan really does them justice.

    Fresh off of Kafka on the Shore, I was motivated to binge some Murakami, and 1Q84 received a strong recommendation from a friend. Murakami dips you head-first into a truly entrancing literary universe, with amazingly elegant world-building and one of my favourite set of leads. Yet, I can't also help but feel that the plot is a bit unfocused compared to his other, more concise books, and that the book gets... a little disturbing. Still, for fans of Murakami or surrealist fiction, I'd definitely recommend 1Q84.

    Economics has the reputation of being the dismal science, with arcane (and often wrong) predictions and little statistical backing. The recent Nobel laureates do a great job of disproving that, showcasing what "Good Economics" really looks like: examining the world through an analytical lens, blending together innovations from statistics, mathematical modeling, and medicine to get a solid grasp on world phenomenon. Easily one of my favourite (~pop) economics books I've read.

    For a book published in 1959 (and penned as a short story in 1958), Flowers for Algernon ages surprisingly well. We watch the transformation of a man who has been failed by society time and time again; it's telling that this story could've been very well set in 2020, with little impact on its narrative. By far one of the tamest controversial banned books that I've ever read, and if anything, a great introspective short read for young adults.

    The novel that really shot Murakami into national and international fame is beautiful, nuanced, and emotional.

    To many, this is Murakami's magnum opus, and I wouldn't disagree. From an extremely mundane and typical man and environment, Murakami conjures yet another fantastical story: one that touches on Japanese suburbia, war crimes in World War II, and a set of relationships set around existentialism and death. As magical as this book is, it's definitely in the "odd reads" category; but still, it has my complete recommendation.

    The Elephant Vanishes is an intriguing set of short stories, combining seemingly banal life stories and environments with a deep dive into surrealism, loneliness, and trauma.

    One of the most influential economics books in the past decade. The most cited economist of the past 10 years. Possibly the most important question at the crossroads of political science and economics. Why Nations Fail pulls no punches as Acemoglu and Robinson explain their simple but crucial theory: that nations thrive from inclusive economic and political institutions, and fail by their extractive counterparts. They analyze nations throughout human history, starting with the Roman Empire and ending with the status quo and American neoimperialism; and in each case, they prove their mettle as award-winners in their field and reinforce the importance of inclusive institutions. At the end of the day, this has been one of the most comprehensive magnum opus-style books that I've read, and one that I'd wholeheartedly recommend to anybody.

    This short and sweet book is a great exploration into the moral limits of markets. Sandel showcases the skill that made Justice so famous (and probably makes him a great professor, though I can't comment firsthand on that): he clearly distills moral conundrums into separate and distinct philosophical issues, and tackles each of them in methodical but easily-understood steps. As he explored a set of personable (and sometimes, absolutely absurd) markets, I feel like I've come away with a better understanding of why some things shouldn't be commodified. My only complaint is that this book isn't longer.

    George Orwell's magnum opus is just as much of a page-turner on the fifth read as it is on the first. Throughout the years, I've always held this book in a special place in my heart: what Orwell has to say has profound impacts on how we view our past, how we live our present, and how we decide our future. So many things cement this book as a literary classic: its countless neologisms that have pervaded pop culture and political science, its genre-defining exploration of totalitarianism, imperialism, and power, and its commentary on the relationship between language, thought, and freedom. Excited to take it up again soon.

    Murakami does it again, trapping me within the confines of his narrative world: I finished the entire book in just one night! Yet in Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki, Murakami isn't exploring a surrealist or fantastical world: we follow a normal person - someone almost too mediocre - as they go through a muted mid-life crisis. There is a strong sense of intimacy as Murakami delves deep into pain, protection, and human psychology. I'm left feeling both introspectively pleased and depressed, in a light-and-dark sort of way - but certainly with colour.

    This book is ultimately a manifesto for the work that Banerjee and Duflo (and to an extent, Michael Kremer) undertook that ultimately won them their Nobel prize: a granular, experimental approach to alleviating global poverty (especially with RCTs).

Definitely a book that I'll revisit in the future.

Even though the events of this book precede the Voting Rights Act, the institutions that Kozol criticizes still continue to marginalize students 55 years later. Each chapter is a cycle of sobering insight, heartbreak, and rage against the system. An essential read for anybody looking to get into education.

A Wild Sheep Chase is no exception: I was once again immediately transported to his slightly magical rendition of Japan, seamlessly exploring the world through the narrator's eyes. Compared to some of his other works, I think this book is a bit more open-ended and tangled - in a charming, page-turning way.

    As with The Elephant Vanishes, Murakami writes another enjoyable set of short stories. The overarching motif - men, who for some reason or another, are lonely and without women - is by no means new, but Murakami applies it in a very intriguing and exciting way. Still, short stories from Murakami always leave more to be desired - I want more exploration, more world-building, more twists and turns. And of course, the stories get a bit weird sometimes. I still enjoyed reading this compilation; Yesterday and Kino are definitely my favourites.

The investigation of consciousness, mind, and identity are certainly intriguing. A definite recommendation on my end.

    Another rollercoaster romance novel from Murakami. I've definitely settled into his writing style and pattern, yet each new book is still a page-turner. South of the Border, West of the Sun mostly abandons the mystical to explore a damaged lonely man. The book manfiests most of Murakami's archetypal characters, but still finds nuance in our protagonist. In some senses, this book reads very similarly to Norwegian Wood, but it also shines in its own way.

    Murakami keeps the formula without making it too repetitive. Sputnik Sweetheart is a story about sweethearts, but not in the conventional blend of romantic fantasy or tension.

    A unique Murakami piece. Even though it's a "sequel" to A Wild Sheep Chase, the difference in tone and story direction is palpable. This is the most American our narrator gets - I can easily see why Murakami had fun writing this book. The prototypical Murakami protagonist is further developed, with a somewhat unique ensemble cast of supporting characters. The book is also more anti-capitalist than I expected! Mostly a strong recommend from me. I will say - not the largest fan of adults dating 13 year-old girls, even in literature - but maybe that's just me.

    Another curiously unique Murakami piece. Instead of a grand narrative epic, we have the happenings of just one night in Tokyo. There's a startingly different, but equally inquisitive omniscient-ish narrator. The tone and environment is masterfully set. Yet, as much as I loved the writing, I think the ending is a bit vague - even for a Murakami book. The narrative strings are just a little too loose to be intertwined. Still quite enjoyable, but not my most enthusiastic recommendation.

    What a strange book. Compared to Hear the Wind Sing, Pinball really develops the Murakami eccentricity: unnaturally lonely men, mysterious women, and hyperfixation on the most normal, strange parts of life. It's also a very jumpy, loose book - this is the start of the dual narrative that Murakami uses so frequently in his later works. Reflecting on reading the Trilogy of the Rat + Dance Dance Dance, it's interesting to see just how stylistically different each of these books are.

I'm no painter, but I loved the exploration of art and an artists psyche. Murakami effortlessly blends historical flashbacks with a slightly surrealist world à la The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle or A Wild Sheep Chase. I'm also more drawn to our unnamed hero more than the typical Murakami protagonist. All-around, a book worth the lengthy buy-in, though it's not the first Murakami book I'd recommend you.

I'll admit, much of this book went over my head: I am barely familiar with Nietzsche, Freud, or Foucault, and I am no scholar of Don Quixote nor Cioran. Still, Dienstag's deep dive into the linearity of time and the constant human struggle was intriguing. Certainly, it's reinvigorated the interest in philosophy I've had over the years. I'll probably revisit this book in a decade or so.

I really enjoyed how Kat Holmes frames exclusion as a set of mismatches between humans and systems. And, Holmes brings forward interesting case studies and historical trends that shape inclusive and exclusive design. However, I can't help but wish that the book went on longer: either in depth, exploring specific design choices and Kat's design style, or in breadth, in examining more arenas for inclusive design. In some senses, Mismatch reads like a foreword for a book that isn't there. Nevertheless, an enjoyable read!

She balances a blunt and concise telling of history with an inside look at the European and American centre-right, and its spiral into ... what we have today. In some ways, she is the perfect person to tell this story, from her husband's political career in Poland to awkward drinks with Boris Johnson and her chance interactions with Conrad Black. She effortlessly interleaves post-Cold War anti-communism with English nationalism and the Republican party. Ultimately, I'm glad I took a chance on Applebaum, even if her politics is at odds with mine.

He unites the views of Hayek, Rawls, and Frank Knight to reject merit in economics and in morals. I particularly enjoyed his exploration of college admissions as a flawed form of credentialism, what he calls the "last acceptable prejudice". To be honest, I think I subconsciouly take part in this credentialism - and it's always good to read books that spark introspection. Overall a solid recommendation, even if there are a few strange tangents.

    I've never been a huge memoir person, but Michelle Zauner is changing my mind. Crying in H Mart is a direct channel for her emotions: pain, love, and loss bleed through each page. She brings us intimately into her family and tells a story that you can taste and smell as much as you can read. She juggles a set of experiences that I find all too relatable: of parental struggle, fitting in neither in America nor in Asia, and ultimately, a feeling of hopelessness. A strong recommend.

    The Memory Police is a harrowing exploration of humanity grounded in memory. Ogawa creates a mysterious authoritarian state that rivals Orwell's or Bradbury's, but brings a certain balance of intimacy and coldness that renders this novel particularly terrifying. Her writing style is terse, exploratory, wrapping tendrils around your mind - and she doesn't let go. Overall a strong recommend.

    One Hundred Years of Solitude is an epic in every sense of the word. Márquez dives deep into a world as surreal as it is engaging; the chronicles of the Buendía family span every genre but ultimately hones in on inevitable solitude. It's quite tough for me to describe exactly just how beautiful this book is. I will say - it was a rather hard read for me to get through, but I'd still recommend it as a pinnacle of modern literature.

    Yes, yes, everybody's talking about Dune. I quite enjoyed the read! Dune is such a cornerstone of science fiction. By mostly eschewing crazy technology, Herbert puts humanity itself in the front-and-center. I'm especially fond of Dune's focus on ecology and religion. Beyond the book itself, I now better understand the full impact Dune has had on modern science fiction and pop science as a whole. My only caveat is that Dune - like other fantastical epics - requires quite a bit of buy-in to process the worldbuilding. I think for any science fiction fan, Dune is a must-read.

    The Sympathizer is anger, confusion, and nihilism manifested into literature. Nguyen's writing style is deeply intimate and shocking, if dramatic at times. The narrator's whirlwind tour of the aftermath of the Vietnam War is as enthralling as it is disturbing. Commentary seeps in to every page of the book: on war, political ideology, hypocrisy, sex, dignity, allegiance, propaganda and ultimately, duality. Nothing is worth more than independence and freedom.

    Levitsky and Ziblatt provide a strong intuition for long-term success of democracy. Norms, not constitutions or separation of powers, uphold democracy. Two key tenets - mutual toleration and the lack of constitutional hardball - perfectly describe the past as well as the two years immediately following the book's publication. I do have minor grievances: a focus on Europe and the Americas leaves us with little in the lens of democracy in Africa, and there's a peculiar framing around Reconstruction and Jim Crow. Nevertheless, the book achieves its twin goals quite well: combatting Trumpism and arguing for a safer American democracy.

Jean-Baptiste does bring up relevant points on the importance of product inclusion, balancing the human and business case, and bringing inclusion into each element of the design phase. However, it all just feels a bit off - both in how glorified Google is in the book, and in the mismatch of depth of context and advice. The sidebars from other people in industry are also a mixed bag. Overall, I don't regret reading the book, but it doesn't reach the bar that Design Justice has set.

Cline tells an immersive story filled with geekdom and potshots at commercial capitalism - it's very impressive that this is his first novel. That being said, I can't get over the weird, almost incel-y vibes of the protagonist; I have similar critiques for in-universe classics like Revenge of the Nerds.

    In the foreword, Abraham Verghese says that he only deeply knew Paul after his death by reading this book. I can't disagree there: Kalanithi's prose and wit is laser-sharp in this 200-odd page autobiography, and I really did come away feeling like I understood his purpose and perspective. His relationship with death and work stood out to me as uniquely insightful; in a much lesser degree, I see parallels with my relationship with teaching. I think I'm not at a point in my life yet where this book would fundamentally shake my worldview, but it's one that I plan on revisiting in ten years.

    The content of this book is tragic, even if the prose isn't perfect. I'm not sure if I would've recommended this book for [UCLA's Common Experience](https://dailybruin.com/2019/02/13/author-of-ucla-common-book-discusses-experience-as-border-patrol-agent), but it's certainly an interesting - if depressing - read.

    I love love love all of Randall's work (this is especially apparent if you're my student). No exception here - an extraordinarily fun and slightly educational read. I loved the focus on kids' questions this time around!

    I read this book on a flight and thus didn't do it justice. The breadth of possible literary analysis on this book astounds me, even if I wasn't gripped in the first read. It's so dense with metaphor that ... I'll have to revisit this another time. Nevertheless, I'll try to pick up more Calvino!

    I'm too used to the American political battleground and culture. Living in the US for almost 5 years is making me a bit complacent! Piketty rips me straight out of this bubble in his most accessible work yet; analyzing in-depth the history of equality from the 1800s to the present-day. He doesn't pull any punches; it's been a while since I've read an economics book that is so concise, ambitious, and at times, ruthless. I'm just in awe of how much he's able to convey in so few pages; I'm particularly impressed by just how well he argues points about slavery and colonialism, inequality in education, and environmental justice. His ambitious future is one that I want to fight for. I can't recommend this book enough for anyone remotely interested in economic justice. And, it's pushing me to reread Capital again ... which I'll do soon :)

    I'm once again deeply moved by Kozol's writing. Like I'd expect from a teacher, it has a healthy balance of passionate idealism, childlike love, and a "wiggily" whimsy that makes this such a smooth read. I'm also in awe of the breadth of the topics that Kozol and Francesca (the titular teacher) discussed: micro-interactions, macro policy decisions, and above all the true, child-focused mission for education. I'm particularly impressed by his concise points on school vouchers, standardized testing crunches, and issues with education diversity work. I'm glad I read this before starting to become a full-time teacher myself; and I hope to have a mentor like Kozol, or a peer like Francesca.
