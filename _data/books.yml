    Kafka on the Shore was my first Murakami venture, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The world that Murakami weaves is immaculate; I feel at home in a place that I've never been in. Kafka's ensemble of characters bring just enough to the table to make every chapter a page-turner, but leave plenty to the imagination - and something that makes this coming-of-age story easily and eerily relatable.

    At ICYD 2016 (a debate competition in London), I watched some of the world's best youth debaters argue over the concept of open borders. At the time (especially given the rise of anti-immigration sentiment in Europe), it seemed like a tough principle to advocate for, but Bryan Caplan does a pretty solid attempt at doing just that in Open Borders. I do think that the comic book medium is narratively interesting (and I love SMBC), but I think it might've hindered Caplan's message just a bit - especially as he has less leeway to delve deep into rigorous economic experiments. And at the end of the day, many open borders arguments are in a "what if" limbo, but Caplan really does them justice.

    Fresh off of Kafka on the Shore, I was motivated to binge some Murakami, and 1Q84 received a strong recommendation from a friend. Murakami dips you head-first into a truly entrancing literary universe, with amazingly elegant world-building and one of my favourite set of leads. Yet, I can't also help but feel that the plot is a bit unfocused compared to his other, more concise books, and that the book gets... a little disturbing. Still, for fans of Murakami or surrealist fiction, I'd definitely recommend 1Q84.

    Economics has the reputation of being the dismal science, with arcane (and often wrong) predictions and little statistical backing. The recent Nobel laureates do a great job of disproving that, showcasing what "Good Economics" really looks like: examining the world through an analytical lens, blending together innovations from statistics, mathematical modeling, and medicine to get a solid grasp on world phenomenon. Easily one of my favourite (~pop) economics books I've read.

    For a book published in 1959 (and penned as a short story in 1958), Flowers for Algernon ages surprisingly well. We watch the transformation of a man who has been failed by society time and time again; it's telling that this story could've been very well set in 2020, with little impact on its narrative. By far one of the tamest controversial banned books that I've ever read, and if anything, a great introspective short read for young adults.

    To many, this is Murakami's magnum opus, and I wouldn't disagree. From an extremely mundane and typical man and environment, Murakami conjures yet another fantastical story: one that touches on Japanese suburbia, war crimes in World War II, and a set of relationships set around existentialism and death. As magical as this book is, it's definitely in the "odd reads" category; but still, it has my complete recommendation.

    The Elephant Vanishes is an intriguing set of short stories, combining seemingly banal life stories and environments with a deep dive into surrealism, loneliness, and trauma.

    One of the most influential economics books in the past decade. The most cited economist of the past 10 years. Possibly the most important question at the crossroads of political science and economics. Why Nations Fail pulls no punches as Acemoglu and Robinson explain their simple but crucial theory: that nations thrive from inclusive economic and political institutions, and fail by their extractive counterparts. They analyze nations throughout human history, starting with the Roman Empire and ending with the status quo and American neoimperialism; and in each case, they prove their mettle as award-winners in their field and reinforce the importance of inclusive institutions. At the end of the day, this has been one of the most comprehensive magnum opus-style books that I've read, and one that I'd wholeheartedly recommend to anybody.

    This short and sweet book is a great exploration into the moral limits of markets. Sandel showcases the skill that made Justice so famous (and probably makes him a great professor, though I can't comment firsthand on that): he clearly distills moral conundrums into separate and distinct philosophical issues, and tackles each of them in methodical but easily-understood steps. As he explored a set of personable (and sometimes, absolutely absurd) markets, I feel like I've come away with a better understanding of why some things shouldn't be commodified. My only complaint is that this book isn't longer.

    George Orwell's magnum opus is just as much of a page-turner on the fifth read as it is on the first. Throughout the years, I've always held this book in a special place in my heart: what Orwell has to say has profound impacts on how we view our past, how we live our present, and how we decide our future. So many things cement this book as a literary classic: its countless neologisms that have pervaded pop culture and political science, its genre-defining exploration of totalitarianism, imperialism, and power, and its commentary on the relationship between language, thought, and freedom. Excited to take it up again soon.

    Murakami does it again, trapping me within the confines of his narrative world: I finished the entire book in just one night! Yet in Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki, Murakami isn't exploring a surrealist or fantastical world: we follow a normal person - someone almost too mediocre - as they go through a muted mid-life crisis. There is a strong sense of intimacy as Murakami delves deep into pain, protection, and human psychology. I'm left feeling both introspectively pleased and depressed, in a light-and-dark sort of way - but certainly with colour.

    This book is ultimately a manifesto for the work that Banerjee and Duflo (and to an extent, Michael Kremer) undertook that ultimately won them their Nobel prize: a granular, experimental approach to alleviating global poverty (especially with RCTs).

Definitely a book that I'll revisit in the future.

Even though the events of this book precede the Voting Rights Act, the institutions that Kozol criticizes still continue to marginalize students 55 years later. Each chapter is a cycle of sobering insight, heartbreak, and rage against the system. An essential read for anybody looking to get into education.

A Wild Sheep Chase is no exception: I was once again immediately transported to his slightly magical rendition of Japan, seamlessly exploring the world through the narrator's eyes. Compared to some of his other works, I think this book is a bit more open-ended and tangled - in a charming, page-turning way.

    As with The Elephant Vanishes, Murakami writes another enjoyable set of short stories. The overarching motif - men, who for some reason or another, are lonely and without women - is by no means new, but Murakami applies it in a very intriguing and exciting way. Still, short stories from Murakami always leave more to be desired - I want more exploration, more world-building, more twists and turns. And of course, the stories get a bit weird sometimes. I still enjoyed reading this compilation; Yesterday and Kino are definitely my favourites.

The investigation of consciousness, mind, and identity are certainly intriguing. A definite recommendation on my end.

    Another rollercoaster romance novel from Murakami. I've definitely settled into his writing style and pattern, yet each new book is still a page-turner. South of the Border, West of the Sun mostly abandons the mystical to explore a damaged lonely man. The book manfiests most of Murakami's archetypal characters, but still finds nuance in our protagonist. In some senses, this book reads very similarly to Norwegian Wood, but it also shines in its own way.

    Murakami keeps the formula without making it too repetitive. Sputnik Sweetheart is a story about sweethearts, but not in the conventional blend of romantic fantasy or tension.

Quite an enjoyable late-night read.

    A unique Murakami piece. Even though it's a "sequel" to A Wild Sheep Chase, the difference in tone and story direction is palpable. This is the most American our narrator gets - I can easily see why Murakami had fun writing this book. The prototypical Murakami protagonist is further developed, with a somewhat unique ensemble cast of supporting characters. The book is also more anti-capitalist than I expected! Mostly a strong recommend from me. I will say - not the largest fan of adults dating 13 year-old girls, even in literature - but maybe that's just me.

    Another curiously unique Murakami piece. Instead of a grand narrative epic, we have the happenings of just one night in Tokyo. There's a startingly different, but equally inquisitive omniscient-ish narrator. The tone and environment is masterfully set. Yet, as much as I loved the writing, I think the ending is a bit vague - even for a Murakami book. The narrative strings are just a little too loose to be intertwined. Still quite enjoyable, but not my most enthusiastic recommendation.

    What a strange book. Compared to Hear the Wind Sing, Pinball really develops the Murakami eccentricity: unnaturally lonely men, mysterious women, and hyperfixation on the most normal, strange parts of life. It's also a very jumpy, loose book - this is the start of the dual narrative that Murakami uses so frequently in his later works. Reflecting on reading the Trilogy of the Rat + Dance Dance Dance, it's interesting to see just how stylistically different each of these books are.

I'm no painter, but I loved the exploration of art and an artists psyche. Murakami effortlessly blends historical flashbacks with a slightly surrealist world à la The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle or A Wild Sheep Chase. I'm also more drawn to our unnamed hero more than the typical Murakami protagonist. All-around, a book worth the lengthy buy-in, though it's not the first Murakami book I'd recommend you.

I'll admit, much of this book went over my head: I am barely familiar with Nietzsche, Freud, or Foucault, and I am no scholar of Don Quixote nor Cioran. Still, Dienstag's deep dive into the linearity of time and the constant human struggle was intriguing. Certainly, it's reinvigorated the interest in philosophy I've had over the years. I'll probably revisit this book in a decade or so.

I really enjoyed how Kat Holmes frames exclusion as a set of mismatches between humans and systems. And, Holmes brings forward interesting case studies and historical trends that shape inclusive and exclusive design. However, I can't help but wish that the book went on longer: either in depth, exploring specific design choices and Kat's design style, or in breadth, in examining more arenas for inclusive design. In some senses, Mismatch reads like a foreword for a book that isn't there. Nevertheless, an enjoyable read!

She balances a blunt and concise telling of history with an inside look at the European and American centre-right, and its spiral into ... what we have today. In some ways, she is the perfect person to tell this story, from her husband's political career in Poland to awkward drinks with Boris Johnson and her chance interactions with Conrad Black. She effortlessly interleaves post-Cold War anti-communism with English nationalism and the Republican party. Ultimately, I'm glad I took a chance on Applebaum, even if her politics is at odds with mine.

He unites the views of Hayek, Rawls, and Frank Knight to reject merit in economics and in morals. I particularly enjoyed his exploration of college admissions as a flawed form of credentialism, what he calls the "last acceptable prejudice". To be honest, I think I subconsciouly take part in this credentialism - and it's always good to read books that spark introspection. Overall a solid recommendation, even if there are a few strange tangents.

    I've never been a huge memoir person, but Michelle Zauner is changing my mind. Crying in H Mart is a direct channel for her emotions: pain, love, and loss bleed through each page. She brings us intimately into her family and tells a story that you can taste and smell as much as you can read. She juggles a set of experiences that I find all too relatable: of parental struggle, fitting in neither in America nor in Asia, and ultimately, a feeling of hopelessness. A strong recommend.

    The Memory Police is a harrowing exploration of humanity grounded in memory. Ogawa creates a mysterious authoritarian state that rivals Orwell's or Bradbury's, but brings a certain balance of intimacy and coldness that renders this novel particularly terrifying. Her writing style is terse, exploratory, wrapping tendrils around your mind - and she doesn't let go. Overall a strong recommend.

    One Hundred Years of Solitude is an epic in every sense of the word. Márquez dives deep into a world as surreal as it is engaging; the chronicles of the Buendía family span every genre but ultimately hones in on inevitable solitude. It's quite tough for me to describe exactly just how beautiful this book is. I will say - it was a rather hard read for me to get through, but I'd still recommend it as a pinnacle of modern literature.

    Yes, yes, everybody's talking about Dune. I quite enjoyed the read! Dune is such a cornerstone of science fiction. By mostly eschewing crazy technology, Herbert puts humanity itself in the front-and-center. I'm especially fond of Dune's focus on ecology and religion. Beyond the book itself, I now better understand the full impact Dune has had on modern science fiction and pop science as a whole. My only caveat is that Dune - like other fantastical epics - requires quite a bit of buy-in to process the worldbuilding. I think for any science fiction fan, Dune is a must-read.

    The Sympathizer is anger, confusion, and nihilism manifested into literature. Nguyen's writing style is deeply intimate and shocking, if dramatic at times. The narrator's whirlwind tour of the aftermath of the Vietnam War is as enthralling as it is disturbing. Commentary seeps in to every page of the book: on war, political ideology, hypocrisy, sex, dignity, allegiance, propaganda and ultimately, duality. Nothing is worth more than independence and freedom.

    Levitsky and Ziblatt provide a strong intuition for long-term success of democracy. Norms, not constitutions or separation of powers, uphold democracy. Two key tenets - mutual toleration and the lack of constitutional hardball - perfectly describe the past as well as the two years immediately following the book's publication. I do have minor grievances: a focus on Europe and the Americas leaves us with little in the lens of democracy in Africa, and there's a peculiar framing around Reconstruction and Jim Crow. Nevertheless, the book achieves its twin goals quite well: combatting Trumpism and arguing for a safer American democracy.

Jean-Baptiste does bring up relevant points on the importance of product inclusion, balancing the human and business case, and bringing inclusion into each element of the design phase. However, it all just feels a bit off - both in how glorified Google is in the book, and in the mismatch of depth of context and advice. The sidebars from other people in industry are also a mixed bag. Overall, I don't regret reading the book, but it doesn't reach the bar that Design Justice has set.

Cline tells an immersive story filled with geekdom and potshots at commercial capitalism - it's very impressive that this is his first novel. That being said, I can't get over the weird, almost incel-y vibes of the protagonist; I have similar critiques for in-universe classics like Revenge of the Nerds.

For that reason alone, I find The Handmaid's Tale spectacular.

I can't disagree there: Kalanithi's prose and wit is laser-sharp in this 200-odd page autobiography, and I really did come away feeling like I understood his purpose and perspective. His relationship with death and work stood out to me as uniquely insightful; in a much lesser degree, I see parallels with my relationship with teaching. I think I'm not at a point in my life yet where this book would fundamentally shake my worldview, but it's one that I plan on revisiting in ten years.

    I'm too used to the American political battleground and culture. Living in the US for almost 5 years is making me a bit complacent! Piketty rips me straight out of this bubble in his most accessible work yet; analyzing in-depth the history of equality from the 1800s to the present-day. He doesn't pull any punches; it's been a while since I've read an economics book that is so concise, ambitious, and at times, ruthless. I'm just in awe of how much he's able to convey in so few pages; I'm particularly impressed by just how well he argues points about slavery and colonialism, inequality in education, and environmental justice. His ambitious future is one that I want to fight for. I can't recommend this book enough for anyone remotely interested in economic justice. And, it's pushing me to reread Capital again ... which I'll do soon :)

    I'm once again deeply moved by Kozol's writing.

I'm also in awe of the breadth of the topics that Kozol and Francesca (the titular teacher) discussed: micro-interactions, macro policy decisions, and above all the true, child-focused mission for education. I'm particularly impressed by his concise points on school vouchers, standardized testing crunches, and issues with education diversity work. I'm glad I read this before starting to become a full-time teacher myself; and I hope to have a mentor like Kozol, or a peer like Francesca.

    In a depressing way, this is a great read for anybody who works adjacent to tech. Brotopia serves a great balance between delving into individual experiences (which much of tech reporting doesn't) while still tacking the underpinning social dynamics and properly attributing blame (which is lacking from books like Lean In). I'm quite impressed by how ahead of the curve some of Chang's reporting has been; in 2018, I don't think the relationship between tech, polyamory, and sex was as commonplace as it is now (post-SBF/FTX). I did chuckle a bit at some of her examples of "good" companies - Riot strikes me as one that seems particularly poor in retrospect. If anything, it's a reminder that tech doesn't inherently create good examples of anti-sexism; it requires deliberate, prolonged work. I'm curious what Chang would add if she rewrote this book today, and look forward to her next work!

    From an analytical perspective, this is powerful literature: Morrison pulls no punches with symbolism, clashing motifs around the definition of home, and a jittery set of narrative perspectives that uncover each piece of the puzzle. In particular, I'm impressed by her reserved and concise portrayal of PTSD. However, I can't say that it's moved me in the same way that Homegoing did. This is still a great read, and I think it deserves a thorough literary lens for its best enjoyment - not an interrupted read on the T.

    I'm quite surprised by how humble Bernake, Geithner, and Paulson are in decade-out retrospective. *Firefighting* is blazingly short but quite accessible; along the timeline of the crisis, the trio touches on everything from various financial instruments to non-bank entitites and the obligations their respective institutions have to the United States. I hadn't realized that they intended to rescue Lehman (though, as they admit, this was intentionally obfuscated), and I didn't realize how late public stress tests were introduced to the financial system. I only wished that they spent more time talking about the (ever-controversial) QE package. While this is obviously a biased retelling of the events and lessons to be learned, it's quite effective - and one that scratches the itch I had in high school (where my dream job was to work for the CFPB)!

    I'm left feeling quite whelmed. I completely buy into the thesis of this book: measurements (and units) are (somewhat arbitrarily) grounded in deep history, but encode profound amounts of power and can be used to oppress. Vincent hits on some interesting tidbits, including the ties measurement has to European revolutionaries, Pax Americana, and the tie between IQ and eugenics. But, I feel like so much more was left on the table. I would have liked to see discussions about the role of census data, gerrymandering, and property rights; about standardized testing or credit scores or GDP; or, a focus on measurement outside of the West. Regardless, it's given me some food for thought, which I greatly appreciate!

    Three strong recommendations in a row - I can't get enough of Kozol. I'm surprised at how versatile and personable he is. This book reads just like *Death at an Early Age* and *Letters to a Young Teacher*, even though the latter two are first-hand and epistolary in nature. He makes a blistering argument against the regression back into segregated schooling by providing a delicate balance between individual stories about children and teachers, arguments about school districts and states, and heavy-handed analysis of federal policy. His argumentation is so effective yet so polite; filled with rage, but directed with a measured approach. It's a depressing read, and unfortunately, the backslide has continued. For example, the Thurgood Marshall school he writes about [still is almost entirely black and hispanic](https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/schoolsearch/school_detail.asp?ID=360008105115). This is one of those books that I really wish every American would read; I'm honestly even going to recommend this to my students.

Yet, even after a re-read, I can't help but feel a bit *bad*: I don't feel the same level of emotion or attachment to the characters as my friends have.

I love this genre of pop linguistics (think *Because Internet*); McWhorter shines some lovely insight into the evolution of human language while keeping a light and playful tone. Interestingly, the book stays surprisingly apolitical (especially given both linguistics as a field, and McWhorter's outspoken views).

    Wow, I loved reading this book! There's much of hip hop history that I'm still unfamiliar with. I especially appreciated Ogbar's discussion of the early Puerto Rican influences in rap, effective criticism of the conscious/gangsta rap dichotomy, and the unexpected John McWhorter hit piece (I just read *Words on the Move* the day before). I also quite appreciated the section on feminism and rap, even if it was much shorter than I wanted it to be. I'd love a part two; the book was written at a (supposed) watershed moment in rap, with Graduation about to outsell Curtis and the subsequent shifts in the genre (from gangsta to pop rap, trap, and now international + experimental). We've since seen a rapid diversification of mainstream rap in many of the axes discussed in the book (race, geography, gender, relationship to political activism). How can we take these lessons into the genre's 50th birthday?

    Kozol is raw and angry in one of his most famous books. His prognosis - that we're significantly undercounting illiterate (adult) Americans, and that our literacy programs are rapidly failing - is as detailed as it is bleak. Like his other work, he effortlessly blends individual experiences from communities that he's visited with broader arguments about nationwide policy and educational norms. That being said, I think there are areas that compare poorly to his later work; in particular, I felt that the ending lost quite a bit of focus and didn't end up being the call to action I wanted it to be. More than his other books, it also reads slightly harsh on the victims of illiteracy and toes the line of uncomfortable saviourism. Nevertheless, I think it's a valuable read. I'm more curious than ever what the state is of literacy in the present day; many of the literacy programs he discussed did collapse, but how did the rise of the internet (and the continued defunding of libraries and schools) pare up with declining absolute poverty?

    This is a fascinating if unconventional read. Sudhir embeds himself in New York's informal economy with a focus on sex work. There are some stellar personal stories from sex workers, drug dealers, and surprisingly, many clients. He's also surprisingly vulernable about his own personal struggles doing this work, ranging from ethics concerns and his desire for prestige to his impending divorce. However, this book also leaves me uneasy. Venkatesh himself identifies the vast moral quandries with this style of sociology, and doesn't pitch this as pure academic research. It reads much more like a slow-burn thriller than a sociology book, and the Freakonomics influence - both good and bad - is clear as day. I'm still not really sure how I feel about this book.

    To be completely honest, I should've read some reviews before picking up this book. It *sounds* really interesting, mostly in a Murakami-like way: the elements of surrealism, social commentary, and cats. But, the book falls pretty flat. I didn't find much depth in the characters, particularly in a protagonist that mirrors all the bad things about Murakami and women. The book has more worldbuilding than Dune, but it doesn't have the narrative or the payoff to justify it. And, at the very end, I feel extraordinarily unsatisfied. I could have accepted this as a prequel to a trilogy, but not as a standalone book. Definitely one of my harshest reviews (and I feel a bit bad!), but I really am quite disappointed.

    Neutrally, this book is exactly what you want from a mid-depth history book. Irons paints stellar pictures of the lead-up to *Brown*, a play-by-play of the multiple hearings it received, and the ultimate failure of its true mission almost 50 years since its ruling. I'm impressed by the depth of the legal review (though I perhaps was looking for slightly more education policy). There are some funny moments too - like Thurgood Marshall giving perhaps his worst-ever Supreme Court appearance in the second round of *Brown*. I'm not particularly convinced of some of the framing that explains the current failures black students face - I think Irons's focus on black single mothers is too individualistic/reductionist - but it's certaily still a prescient set of conclusions now. If you're interested in the legal history behind school segregation, I think this is a great starting point.

    *Arrival* is one of my favourite movies; I owed it to myself to read the original, and wow, am I impressed! *Stories of Your Life* is remarkably moving for such a concise short story. But, it doesn't steal the show. *Tower of Babylon* shows off Chiang's amazing world-building skills, while *Hell Is the Absence of God* demonstrates his unique take on seemingly over done science fiction and fantasy tropes (in this case, angels on Earth). *Liking What You See* and *Seventy-Two Letters* provide opposite approaches in how science fiction engages ethics (ranging from as in-your-face as possible to an ambient background noise). All in all, a wonderfully short set of reads, and a strong recommend!

    I've never been part of the church of Nate Silver - nor some of the eclectic guests in this book, like Donald Rumsfeld - but I can't argue with his results. His take on (the lack of) predictive power and his unabashed nature as a Bayesian make for a very approachable and entertaining read. In particular, I'm pleasantly surprised by the modesty he has for the field of forecasting; most of the competing books in this sphere of pop social science claim to have a perfect theory that models everything. Instead, he engages with the uncomfortable truth that predictions are just hard. I will say that it's very clear where his passions lie; the level of detail for the poker, baseball, and polling chapters significantly overshadow the tail end's focus on climate change or terrorism. Nevertheless, if you're a frequentism-hater, this is the book you should convert your friends with.

    On one hand, this is a delightful read; it's clear that Questlove has a burning passion for music, and he translates this into a narrative surrounding cultural shocks in the United States and the rise of The Roots. It blows my mind that The Fugees, in part, had a break off of their signing party. Broadly, the idea behind this book is stellar - the ending tidbits on the songs from each of the years is a highlight. On the other hand, I feel partially scammed; the book skips over the last 20 years (which, to me, are some of the most interesting ones!), and I expected to read a bit more about the mainstream success of rap and their eventual place on The Tonight Show. I'm also curious how involved Greenman was (his writing credit is pretty downplayed). All in all, still a fun coffee table read!

In many ways, it's the same formula done well: normal person suddenly experiences great change, spy-thriller tension and action, and an ideological battleground for life's bigger questions. It also quirkly features many extremely current references: in this future, tech companies are ubiquitous in an unconventional way. But, I have to say, it felt a bit predictable (though I'm slightly biased having just read Ted Chiang's *Understand*). This is still an exciting read for action thriller fans, but not a mainstay of the genre.

    I wholly agree with the thesis of this book: privitization has wreaked havoc on the American public school system, and has largely failed to provide almost any of the benefits its proponents have provided. Ravitch does not pull punches in this takedown. She goes after the who's who of education's villains: from Bush, No Child Left Behind, and Common Core to Obama, Arne Duncan, and Rahm Emanuel; billionaires from the classic Koch brothers and Waltons to new tech of Bill Gates, Reed Hastings, and Mark Zuckerberg; for-profit charter networks like KIPP and educational monopolists like Pearson; grift from local politics all the way up to Betsy DeVos. The irony is not lost on my own personal experience, from CZI and EdTech to TFA and volunteer teachers to the shock I had learning about New Orleans' school system. She brings an aggressive posture and an almost-vitriol that feels like what conservative pundits bring to the table. Yet, to be honest, the book feels slightly off. I'm not sure if this packs the same punch or picks apart arguments with the same precision as her contemporaries. For me, this is still a book worth reading, but it feels a bit too scrambled for it to be a strong recommendation.

    Life forced me to take an unplanned break from reading, but Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow is almost a perfect book to bring me back. A chunk of this book feels like lived experience: from Boston and Los Angeles (I didn't expect to be so surprised by zip codes) and being completely immersed in the culture of video games to a full life of trauma and pain - it all felt almost a little too real. In broad strokes, I think this book occupies the same space as Scott Pilgrim and Ready Player One: a cult classic that leans into (elements of) nerd culture and a terminally-online mastery of references to drive home a point about the human condition (and in particular, love). While it's not perfect - in many ways, for the same reasons as Scott Pilgrim and Ready Player One - this is a fantastical book in its own right. A hefty recommendation, particularly for anybody who's a bit too online or delved a bit too much into making games.

    An enjoyable re-read for me as I slowly grapple with the fact that I'm a person with much more responsibility than three months ago. A handful of things stood out for me during the second read. Most prominently, I'm thankful for Benjamin's frequent direct quoting of other scholars, which both properly credits ideas & provides great rabbit hole material. I forgot just how much criticism she had for Jay-Z, all of which was prescient (and predictive of his crypto fiasco). And, of course, she does a great job of driving home that technology cannot be disentangled with race and power - and that passive action does not stop technology from replicating and amplifying historical injustices. I will say, I didn't remember the pacing of the book - it feels almost like the first half of a lengthier magnum opus (maybe Viral Justice is part two)? And, similar to my experience reading many of these books - I'm left wanting more! That's no dig to Benjamin - after all, I've already read this book and many others - but it is an interesting reflection on my development as a reader.

    Another good re-read as I amp up to teach this material! I enjoyed the book (just like the first time), though a couple of items stood out on the second touch. First, I forgot how much the middle chunk of the book is centered around pornography - which I think is an important (and often ignored!) part of the internet, sociology, and certainly relevant to AI. Of course, Noble's commentary is prescient: transformers and LLMs have only amplified the existing problems she points out with search. Similarly, her discussions on sexualized content, revenge porn, and the right to be forgotten is even more relevant with powerful deepfakes and LLMs. And, her paragraph on teaching ethics to UCLA engineers and the lack of societal content in their curriculum made me chuckle out loud (I first read this before my work at UCLA)! The last realiziation I made - with teaching in mind - is that elements of this book can get academic, even though she does a good job of introducing vocabulary early on. I'm curious to see how teaching this book (eventually?) will go!

I'm particularly impressed by how much identity-driven turmoil he's able to fit within 10 sub-40-page stories. At the same time, I'm glad that he bucks the trend within some diaspora literature that only focuses on trauma. Almost all of his stories are filled with enduring glimmers of hope - and the absurdity of life is sprinkled throughout each story (especially Speedoman). In short, this book is incisive in every definition of the word; strong recommend. My favourite stories were *Money Chickens*, *Zizou's Voice*, and *Yusra*!

Yet, I also can't help but feel that some of the nuance is lost on me - in part because I'm so young. And because it's super weird.

I am once again impressed by the breadth of ethical issues that his stories touch on - while simulatneously engaging in a level of depth worthy of a novella. It also features many of the same (absolutely wonderful) elements of *Stories of Your Life*: the exploration of antiquated pseudoscientific theories, immersion into religious allegory, fictional reframings of foundational scientific and social texts (Walter Ong was an inspiration?!), and vignettes that'd inspire the best Black Mirror episode. Honestly all of these stories were entrancing, but I was particularly moved by *The Merchant and the Alchemist's Gate*, *Exhalation*, *The Lifecycle of Software Objects*, *Omphalos*, and *Anxiety is the Dizziness of Freedom*. Thanks to many for the recommendations, but particularly to Helena who drove it home.

Each of the characters have a unique relationship with math - and each other - that mirrors what I've seen in years of math education.

    It's hard for me to not compare this book to *Homegoing*, which is one of my favourite books of all time. Gyasi's second book is much more reserved and focused on the personal battles of Gifty, a Ghanaian-American PhD student at Stanford. Yet even with this constraint, she still dives deep into generational pain and trauma à la *Homegoing*. A fresh perspective comes from a central focus on faith, science, and their interplay - I feel like Gifty's various experiences are more common than most STEM faculty or students think. I do lack some of the personal context surrounding faith - and with the smaller context, this book didn't hit as hard as the sprawling epics of *Homegoing* and *Pachinko*. Nevertheless, it's given me some great thought.

    Just another stellar ensemble of science fiction ideas from Cixin Liu. Many of the same elements that make *The Three-Body Problem* so engaging are smattered across various stories here too - from the absurd but completely believable science in the titular story and *Cannonball*, to a fascinating alternate history through aliens in Mountain, to a vague but powerful set of political undertones in *Sun of China* and *For the Benefit of Mankind*. I do think the middle set of stories - particularly the break in seriousness in *Curse 5.0* - to be a bit lacking. But, overall, still a quite enjoyabe read! Favourites are *The Wandering Earth*, *Mountain*, *For the Benefit of Mankind*, and *In Her Eyes* + *Cannonball*.

    I read this book in two sittings, the first during the middle of an all-nighter. It felt like a fever dream - and I originally chalked that up to the lack of sleep - but in my second attempt, I realized that's just the experience of reading this book. The core feeling of tension and slight unease in a thriller is perfectly captured in every page of this book, and Calvino keeps your head spinning as you tag along for the ride. It's hard to explain more without fundamentally spoiling this - but it's certainly a unique and splendid read.

    A cute and delightful set of short stories, all about the whimsy of life and dreaming big to get rich. I definitely chuckled at the absurdity of some of the endings. Favourites are *Mushrooms in the city*, *The forest on the superhighway*, *The poisonous rabbit*, *Where the river is more blue*, *Moon and Gnac*, and *Santa's Children*.

    As an avid fan of *The Memory Police* and *The Housekeeper And The Professor*, I can't help but say I'm a little let down. She still masterfully navigates the human psyche with the same subtlety in her previous works, and there's a playful amount of light surrealism that borders whimsy and disturbing/depressing. Yet, I felt that the driving theme had as many misses as it did hits: some stories felt like a framing device for a joke with no punchline (or much revenge). I also didn't feel like any of the stories were particularly gruesome (in contrast to the reviews). I will say, I did enjoy learning more about Yōko through the stories (e.g. that, like the mother in *The Little Dustman*, her husband didn't know about her work until she won a prize). Favourites were *Old Mrs. J* and *Sewing for the Heart*.

    Reading Babel (in one sitting!) reminded me so much of my YA-filled childhood. This almost feels like a second wave! It does feature some of the same tropes, with kids facing inner turmoil as they try to save the world from unjust institutions and ideas. Yet, I felt like it executed so much better on these ideas, with a novel linguistic framing, characters that felt less like caricatures and more like conflicted people in a brutal conflict, and a multi-faceted critique of Western academia that feels glaringly absent in other popular dark academia-style media. I was also pleasantly surprised by the approach Kuang takes on Babel's magic (and in particular, what I feel is a more realistic take on how magic technology would develop). There are still holes: the pacing in both the first and last third of the book is off (too slow, and then way too fast and shallow), and I feel like there's so much more that could've been done with the technology. I also think there are valid critiques on how the underlying arguments resolve (though from my perspective, this is less of an issue --- I don't see Kuang as endorsing the views of our "protagonist"). Still, a delightful experience all-around --- and a book I'd gladly recommend to anybody who wants to get lost in longer-form speculative fiction.

    A different kind of read than Ng's first two books: while *Our Missing Hearts* is still grounded in family dynamics and the parent-child relationship, the setting is much more dystopian. The authoritarian and repressive government feels too overtly racist to be real, yet it mirrors the US's past history of anti-Asian rhetoric and some of the US and Canada's darkest secrets. There were a handful of times where I felt like I had to suspend a bit *too* much disbelief (particularly towards the end), but I still enjoyed the read all-in-all. If you wanted a bit more Hunger Games (or indeed, Babel!) with your Celeste Ng, this is the book for you!

    I'm just floored at how amazing this book is. To be completely honest, I had been putting it off for a while: did I really want to read about a butler reminiscing on his years of service? Not really! But, Ishiguro takes this seemingly-lifeless premise and absolutely runs with it. He expertly weaves in comments on class, legacy, and the decline of the British empire with a heart-wrenching tale of love, sacrifice, and what it means to dedicate your life to your profession. Every little musing and minor character gave me pause; every line feels important. Without exaggeration, this is one of few books I've read that has directly impacted my personal philosophy (and has given me much pause in my own line of work). I cannot recommend this book enough!

    I read this book as part of a book club (s/o y'all!) and thoroughly enjoyed it. The stream-of-consciousness and frequent narrative switches make the book a tricky (and definitely not relaxing) read, but also an extremely exciting one. It's impressive seeing how naturally Woolf slips in and out of various perspectives to develop an overall *mood* in the book. I also found Clarissa, Peter, and Septimus's inner monologues fascinating (if also occasionally disturbing). I will say, I generally struggle with older works, and this was no exception: for a work that's almost 100 years old, there were definitely a few moments that gave me pause (and I wouldn't say that this book has aged perfectly). Yet, I'm still glad I gave it a thorough read (and discussion), particularly to see how it's inpsired an entire lineage of work.

    I feel like Yoko Ogawa is very hit or miss, and this one is slightly more on the miss side. On one hand, she continues to examine the human condition in a nonchalant, lightfooted way --- hiding fascination in the mundane (and in this case, in the countryside and a gorgeous house). On the other hand, I felt like this was just a bit *too* subtle and just a bit *too* loose, almost like a wind-up toy that lost its charge before it finished. I left a bit unsatisfied with how the story closed out. Nevertheless, still fun, but not a strong recommendation.

    Borges is a Spanish-language literary titan that has been on my list for a while, and The Aleph (and others) is my first introduction to his work. Broadly speaking, I'm somewhere between a rabid fan and slightly confused. His stories that lean closer to sci-fi and speculative fiction are absolutely fascinating for me: *The Immortal*, *The Zahir*, and *The Aleph* are a tantalizing triumvirate that explore time and death in the extremely restrictive short story format. I see these as the precursors to everything I love about Ted Chiang's writing and related science fiction! I was also impressed by how well he executes on twists in short stories that are less than four pages long; *The House of Asterion* is my favourite here, but *Emma Zunz* is also quite solid. Yet, I also felt like some of these were almost completely lost to me (e.g. *The Dead Man*, *The Theologians*, or *The Writing of God*). It's hard to know what I'm missing - I'm certainly lacking some cultural context (and am reading a translation), and haven't given these stories the in-depth analysis that they likely deserve. I'm still excited to get through the rest of his collection!

    It's been a while since I've read a book about physics (or more generally, non-fiction science)! Motivated by a book club (and one too many Wikipedia rabbit holes about primordial black holes), I was excited to pick up Mack's book. There's a good amount to love: I especially liked the interviews with other physicists in the book and the discussions about dark matter and dark energy (which I felt bridged the pop science gap quite well). I had never heard of vaccuum decay or ekpyrotic cosmology and was excited to go along fo the ride. Nevertheless, this didn't quite scratch the same itch as some of my all-time favourites (e.g. *Paradox* by Jim Al-Khalili), though it's hard to put my finger on exactly why. Still, a fun read that I'm glad I picked up.

    These short stories have a deep sadness that extends beyond the seemingly happy endings. Even though the core life experience of the characters (or Lahiri) don't exactly overlap with mine, there's an uneasy resonance with the ideas she explores in her stories. I am particularly impressed at how well she conveys loss, community, and the need to constantly reinvent your own identity. Amidst the serious tone, Lahiri still sneaks in pockets of humour and human joy. All in all, lovely short story collection. Favourites were *A Temporary Matter*, *When Mr. Pirzada Came to Dine*, and *The Third and Final Continent*. Thanks Arjun for the gift!

    Just a fantastically depressing read. I wasn't expecting the casual tone of the opening nor the wrecking ball shift in tone halfway through the book. As someone who has had some of - but far from the exact same - thoughts as Esther, I thought this was a particularly convincing display of how abrupt suicidal thoughts and tendencies can be. Not necessarily a book I'd recommend most people, but I'm glad I gave it a read. Thanks Laurel for the rec!

    A somber set of stories that extends the Macondo Cinematic Universe. These stories - especially the eponymous one - do a stellar job of exploring the identity of the individual, the family, and of Colombia, without the magical realism that defined *One Hundred Years of Solitude*. I felt the more space he had, the more powerful the punches of hopelessness were - which meant that my favourites were the two longest, the eponymous *No One Writes to the Colonel* and *There Are No Thieves In This Town*.

    The best way to describe this book is a "slice of a life of solitude". Most chapters are less than five pages long and seem to focus on the mundane. Yet, the deeper, underlying loneliness really permeates through and grips you by the end. As someone also living alone in a city (and arguably, living alone for a long while), I felt like this resonated particularly well. As an aside, it's fascinating to read a book translated to English by the author themselves. I wish I could read Italian and compare the two versions side-by-side - I'm sure there's nuance that I've missed.

    This book almost feels like a combination of poetry and character study. Akbar has conjured up a flawed but magnetic protagonist that you can't help but cheer for, and an ensemble cast of people seeking their own purpose in life as they grapple with addiction, depression, immigration, queerness, and death. I'm impressed by the breadth of struggle that Kaveh covers while maintaining a coherent narrative in a very tight 352 pages. I was especially drawn to a very realistic and nuanced perspective on "imperfect" immigrant parents. A strong recommendation for a specific target audience. Shoutout to the book club!

    This is a beautiful book, no doubt, but I just felt like I didn't get it? I greatly appreciate the premise and the framing of the story: a zombie novel from the perspective of the zombie is a wonderful exploration of identity. But, something about the narrative and prose just didn't end up clicking for me; I didn't feel the same pain and loss that I felt in The Memory Police (an all-time favourite of mine with a similar underlying theme). I still see why this is a much-loved book, but perhaps just not for me! Thanks book club for the rec!

    Wow. I think I'm downright shocked - I can't say that I've read a modern book that is as transgressive as Rejection. Tulathimutte does a stellar job of creating characters that I absolutely hate and love to hate; I couldn't stop hatereading. Each short story (barring the last) is a caricature of a very real person that I know (which shakes me to my core). From my perspective, this is closer to a brilliant satire, born from self-loathing and being terminally online, rather than an endorsement of any of these characters (or an "Incel novel"). My favourites were the ones that hit a little too close to home but were still believable: The Feminist, Pics, and Our Dope Future. I'm still torn with just how heavy-handed Ahegao and Our Dope Future were. I can't say I'd recommend this to most, but it's certainly one of the most interesting books I've read. Thanks Gabe for the rec!

    A haunting and enjoyable read. I quite enjoy the micro-genre books like this and The Memory Police occupy: dystopian, barren, minimalist worlds are the backdrop for a character study on what defines humanity, paired with a laser-focused portrait of a human who is missing something essential. I found Ros Schwartz's (updated) translation to have quite a bit of punch while maintaining a muted, bleak tone; many sentences feel like they'd be the star of a poem. If anything, a bit short - I wished I had a bit more time to live through this world alongside our narrator, particularly in the back half of the book. Still a lovely read, and a hearty recommendation if you liked The Memory Police. Thanks book club for the rec!

    A cozy read that slows down life by just a bit. Chambers does a stellar job of packing a (soft) punch in such a small package (the book is about 160 pages). She conjures a post-scarcity utopia where humans, sentient AI, and (presumably) the natural world co-exist through mutual isolationism. I haven't read much solarpunk, but this was a particularly welcome contrast to my recent binge of cyberpunk media. The core narrative also explores interesting questions on identity, purpose, and our obligation to others. Yet, I felt like the book finished just when it was getting started --- and the brevity left an unsatisfying shallowness to some of the lines she pursued. Still, an overall enjoyable read --- especially if you want something cozy and warm. Thanks book club (and especially, Gabe) for the rec!
